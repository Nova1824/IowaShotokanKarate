- Express disappointment rather than anger
- Dismissal - time out
- Bad Behavior write up for parents
- Be consistent and maintain expectations  Have clear boundaries and routines.
- Encourage them when they show effort - point out what they are doing right
- Be discerning  with feedback. If they are doing something poorly, do not say they are doing well. Don’t cheerlead them. Be accurate. Mix compliments with things they can improve. Give them a direction to improve. Always keep raising the bar.
- Sometimes being goofy or getting students to laugh can re-engage then if they are refusing to participate
- Sometimes varying the activity or gamifying it can re-engage the class

They have to try to grab it before it hits the ground and as soon as they can. Advanced version: kiba dachi and using two hands/balls. Drop left or right or both.
    - Reaction time and focus game: pairs of students stand back to back. Third person holds pad between their backs. The pad holder calls out a technique.
